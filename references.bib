	abstract = {In this study, the connected and automated vehicles ({CAVs}) platooning problem is resolved under a diﬀerential game framework. Three information topologies are considered here. Firstly, Predecessor-following ({PF}) topology is utilized where the vehicles control the distance with respect to the merely nearest predecessor via a sensor link-based information ﬂow. Secondly, Two-predecessor-following topology ({TPF}) is exploited where each vehicle controls the distance with respect to the two nearest predecessors. In this topology, the second predecessor is communicated via a Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) link. The individual trajectories of {CAVs} under the Nash equilibrium are derived in closed-form for these two information topologies. Finally, general information topology is examined and the diﬀerential game is formulated in this context. In all these options, Pontryagin’s principle is employed to investigate the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium and obtain its corresponding trajectories. In the general topology, we suppose numerical computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. All these approaches represent promising and powerful analytical representations of the {CAV} platoons under the diﬀerential games. Simulation experiments have veriﬁed the eﬃciency of the proposed models and their solutions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a nonlinear control law for an automobile to autonomously track a trajectory, provided in real-time, on rapidly varying, off-road terrain. Existing methods can suffer from a lack of global stability, a lack of tracking accuracy, or a dependence on smooth road surfaces, any one of which could lead to the loss of the vehicle in autonomous offroad driving. This work treats automobile trajectory tracking in a new manner, by considering the orientation of the front wheels – not the vehicle’s body – with respect to the desired trajectory, enabling collocated control of the system. A steering control law is designed using the kinematic equations of motion, for which global asymptotic stability is proven. This control law is then augmented to handle the dynamics of pneumatic tires and of the servo-actuated steering wheel. To control vehicle speed, the brake and throttle are actuated by a switching proportional integral ({PI}) controller. The complete control system consumes a negligible fraction of a computer’s resources. It was implemented on a Volkswagen Touareg, “Stanley”, the Stanford Racing Team’s entry in the {DARPA} Grand Challenge 2005, a 132 mi autonomous off-road race. Experimental results from Stanley demonstrate the ability of the controller to track trajectories between obstacles, over steep and wavy terrain, through deep mud puddles, and along cliff edges, with a typical root mean square ({RMS}) crosstrack error of under 0.1 m. In the {DARPA} National Qualiﬁcation Event 2005, Stanley was the only vehicle out of 40 competitors to not hit an obstacle or miss a gate, and in the {DARPA} Grand Challenge 2005 Stanley had the fastest course completion time.},

We propose a path model that generates a reference path with smooth and peak-value-reduced curvature, and a parameterized speed model to be ﬁtted by human driving data. Model parameters are then learned through regression methods, and certain statistical human driving patterns are revealed. The learned model is then evaluated by comparing the generated plan with the collected data by the same human driver.},

	abstract = {Path tracking is one of the most important aspects of autonomous vehicles. The current research focuses on designing path-tracking controllers taking into account the stability of the yaw and the nonholonomic constraints of the vehicle. In most cases, the lateral controller design relies on identifying a path reference point, the one with the shortest distance to the vehicle giving the current state of the vehicle. That restricts the controller’s ability to handle sudden changes of the trajectory heading angle. The present article proposes a new approach that imitates human behavior while driving. It is based on a discrete prediction model that anticipates the future states of the vehicle, allowing the use of the control algorithm in future predicted states augmented with the current controller output. The performance of the proposed approach is verified through several simulations on V-{REP} simulator with different types of maneuvers (double lane change, hook road, S road, and curved road) and a wide range of velocities. Predictive Stanley controller was used compared to the original Stanley controller. The obtained results of the proposed control approach show the advantage and the performance of the technique in terms of minimizing the lateral error and ensuring yaw stability by an average of 53\% and 22\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Accurate calibration of car-following models is essential for understanding human driving behaviors and implementing high-fidelity microscopic simulations. This work proposes a memory-augmented Bayesian calibration technique to capture both uncertainty in the model parameters and the temporally correlated behavior discrepancy between model predictions and observed data. Specifically, we characterize the parameter uncertainty using a hierarchical Bayesian framework and model the temporally correlated errors using Gaussian processes. We apply the Bayesian calibration technique to the intelligent driver model ({IDM}) and develop a novel stochastic car-following model named memory-augmented {IDM} ({MA}-{IDM}). To evaluate the effectiveness of {MA}-{IDM}, we compare the proposed {MA}-{IDM} with Bayesian {IDM} in which errors are assumed to be i.i.d., and our simulation results based on the {HighD} dataset show that {MA}-{IDM} can generate more realistic driving behaviors and provide better uncertainty quantification than Bayesian {IDM}. By analyzing the lengthscale parameter of the Gaussian process, we also show that taking the driving actions from the past five seconds into account can be helpful in modeling and simulating the human driver’s car-following behaviors.},

	abstract = {Vehicle driving safety is inﬂuenced by many factors, including drivers, vehicles, and road environments. The interactions among them are quite complex. Consequently, existing methods that evaluate driving safety perform inadequately because they only consider limited factors and their interactions. As such, it is difﬁcult for kinematics-based and dynamics-based vehicle driving safety assistant systems to adapt to increasingly complex trafﬁc environments. In this paper, we propose a new concept, i.e., the driving safety ﬁeld. The concept makes use of ﬁeld theory to represent risk factors owing to drivers, vehicles, road conditions, and other trafﬁc factors. A uniﬁed model of the driving safety ﬁeld is constructed, which includes the following three parts: 1) a potential ﬁeld, which is determined by nonmoving objects on the roads, such as a stopped vehicle; 2) a kinetic ﬁeld, which is determined by the moving objects on roads, such as vehicles and pedestrians; and 3) a behavior ﬁeld, which is determined by the individual characteristics of drivers. Moreover, the applications of the model are proposed, and its application to a typical carfollowing scenario is illustrated, which evaluates the risks caused by multiple trafﬁc factors. The driving safety ﬁeld can reveal driver–vehicle–road interactions and their inﬂuences on driving safety, as well as predict driving safety trends owing to dynamic changes. In addition, the model can provide a new foundation for establishing driving safety measures and active vehicle control under complex trafﬁc environments.},

The experimental ﬁndings are consistent with a recently proposed theoretical phase diagram for traﬃc near on-ramps [D. Helbing, A. Hennecke, and M. Treiber, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4360 (1999)]. We simulate these situations with a novel continuous microscopic single-lane model, the “intelligent driver model” ({IDM}), using the empirical boundary conditions. All observations, including the coexistence of states, are qualitatively reproduced by describing inhomogeneities with local variations of one model parameter. We show that the results of the microscopic model can be understood by formulating the theoretical phase diagram for bottlenecks in a more general way. In particular, a local drop of the road capacity induced by parameter variations has practically the same eﬀect as an on-ramp.},

It is based on the artificial potential approach and the elastic band theory. The assessment of the emergency path is based on the dynamic performances; the yaw rate and the lateral acceleration of the host vehicle are chosen in this paper. In order to make evasion manoeuvres steadier, a guide potential attached at the front of the obstacle vehicle and a guide potential attached at the rear of the obstacle vehicle are built to affect the moving vehicles in such a way that it encourages the host vehicle to change lane appropriately. Meanwhile, a hazard map of the road environment including the borders and the obstacle vehicles is generated. Thus the forces acting on the corresponding nodes of an elastic band should be zero because of the equilibrium condition; the trajectory with a low hazard is calculated via a numerical method. The simulation results show that the approach is acceptable and leads to a successful collision avoidance manoeuvre in various driving situations.},

The noncooperative game theory is used for modeling the interaction between a human driver and the trajectoryfollowing controller, where the Nash equilibrium solution is derived by distributed model predictive control ({DMPC}) approach. In addition, the elliptic driving safety ﬁeld is introduced to evaluate the driving risk by considering the driver-vehicle-road interactions under different driving contexts. The authority allocation ratio, denoting the ratio between the lateral position error weight of the human driver’s cost function and the trajectoryfollowing controller’s, is determined by the shared dynamic authority allocation strategy designed based on the evaluated driving risk. More importantly, two case studies are provided to verify the elliptic driving safety ﬁeld and the proposed dynamic authority allocation strategy on a straight or curve road. The results show that the proposed strategy can help the vehicle obtain great performance for obstacles avoidance, and the control authority is dynamically shifted between a human driver and the trajectory-following controller according to the evaluated driving risk of current driving condition.},

Both the utility of a given lane and the risk associated with lane changes are determined in terms of longitudinal accelerations calculated with microscopic traffic models. This determination allows for the formulation of compact and general safety and incentive criteria for both symmetric and asymmetric passing rules. Moreover, anticipative elements and the crucial influence of velocity differences of these car-following models are automatically transferred to the lane-changing rules. Although the safety criterion prevents critical lane changes and collisions, the incentive criterion takes into account the advantages and disadvantages of other drivers associated with a lane change via the “politeness factor.” The parameter allows one to vary the motivation for lane changing from purely egoistic to more cooperative driving behavior. This novel feature allows one first to prevent lane changes for a marginal advantage if they obstruct other drivers and second to let an aggressive driver induce the lane change of a slower driver ahead in order to no longer be obstructed. This phenomenon is common for asymmetric passing rules with a dedicated lane for passing. The model is applied to traffic simulations of cars and trucks with the intelligent driver model as the underlying car-following model. An open system with an on-ramp is studied, and the resulting lane-changing rate is investigated as a function of the spatial coordinate as well as a function of traffic density.},
